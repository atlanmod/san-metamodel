# San-metamodel

Meta-model for designing sensors and actuators networks.

## Installation

Import the given projets (minus the model project) in Eclipse, and start a new Runtime-configuration.
The new Eclipse hence started enables the creation of SAN models.
The provided Model project can be imported in the Runtime-configuration, and be used as a example for understanding the model-driven framework.

## Design

The included Sirius design project proposes a GUI for creating SAN models.
Two representations are proposed. 
  - A first one focuses on the structural aspects of CPS, and enables the creation of Instruments, Features, Devices, Measures, Measurand, and their embedded Parameters and Arguments.
  - A second one focuses on the behavioural aspects of CPS, and enables the creation of Triggers and Processes, and their link with the existing entities of the Structural Aspects.
